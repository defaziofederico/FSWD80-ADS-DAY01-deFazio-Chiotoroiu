1. Pacman cannot go trough walls.
 	2a.If Pacman tries to go through a wall, the wall stops him
 	2b. If Pacman goes through a empty wall (lets call it x="500"), he comes back on the other side (lets call it x="-500")

2. The ghosts do not come out all at the same time
3.  Possible movements of ghosts and Pacman are only in x and y (as it twodimensional), so up,down,left, right;
4. If Pacman eats most of the point in the lower part of the screen, the ghosts will mostly move in the upper part.
